<h2 id="about">What is this?</h2>

In Busy Hour we use [hono](https://github.com/honojs/hono) as our backend framework and we really love it's performance compare with [express](https://github.com/expressjs/express) performances. Unfortunately, as the times goes on we found out that [hono](https://github.com/honojs/hono) just cannot provide the thing we really like which is an event driven pattern. Therefore, to compensate the lack of support for event driven pattern we choose to develop our own backend framework on top of [hono](https://github.com/honojs/hono) by following some of the implementation that inspired by [moleculer](https://github.com/moleculerjs/moleculer) implementation.
